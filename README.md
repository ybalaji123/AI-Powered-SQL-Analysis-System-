What it does?
🔹 SQL AI — Upload any CSV/Excel file and ask questions in plain English. The AI converts your question into SQL, runs it instantly, and gives you a smart summary of the results.

🔹 PDF AI (RAG) — Upload any PDF and ask questions about its content. The app uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to find the most relevant sections and answer accurately.

🔹 Data Cleaning & Visualization — Automatically handles missing values, duplicates, and generates beautiful interactive charts (histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and more).

🔹 Secure Authentication — Firebase Auth for seamless sign-in, sign-up, and password reset.
